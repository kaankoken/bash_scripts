# Local git initializer
If you have a job or work on projects, you probably have one personal and one job-related account.
Moreover, most probably, you have already defined one of the accounts as a global account. This script enables
you to change your `git config` in one go. You do not need to search the web or remember a series of git codes.
It is easy to use. You can use it with `localgit` after you configure it.

# ADB attachment over WI-FI
If you do not want to drain battery of your computer, overcharge your phone or use your phone without any cable attachment, this script is prepared for you.
Just be sure to install `ADB` to your computer.
You can use it with `adbwifi` after you configure it.
