# Local git initializer
If you have a job or work on projects, you probably have one personal and one job-related account. Moreover, most probably, you have already defined one of the accounts as a global account. This script enables you to change your `git config` in one go. You do not need to search the web or remember a series of git codes. It is easy to use.
